<div><b>4. Future Directions</b></div><div>


The next major advance in medical records is not going to be a new
software program that runs on a database isolated within a single
healthcare organization. The next advance will be the creation of a
distributed ledger which will effectively transfer control of patient
records from the healthcare organization to the individual. When medical
records become as freely mobile as people, we will have made a
tremendous leap forward in medicine. Blockchain technology is the key
scientific breakthrough enabling this major step forward.</div><div>


</div><div>The process of making the medical records of individuals readily
accessible requires the use of distributed databases stored on the cloud
in a secure yet open manner. The records must be secure, immutable, and
at the same time easily accessible. Blockchain technology is the vehicle
that makes all of these goals possible
