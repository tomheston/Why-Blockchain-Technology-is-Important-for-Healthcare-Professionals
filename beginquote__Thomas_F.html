<b>Abstract.</b> Blockchain technology is a system of creating an
immutable, secure, distributed database of transactions. Blockchains
were initially created to provide a distributed ledger of financial
transactions that did not rely upon a central bank, credit company, or
other financial institution. The technological breakthrough, however,
has been extended to transactions involving legal matters, medical
records, insurance billing, and smart contracts. One primary way that
blockchain technology is important to healthcare professionals in that
it can revolutionize medical database interoperability. This greater
interoperability can help improve access to medical records, imaging
archives, prescription databases. Given that a patientâ€™s medical history
is a primary cornerstone of good medicine, blockchain technology has the
potential to dramatically improve medical care.</div></div></blockquote><div><div></div><div><b>Introduction</b></div><div>


Blockchain technology is a system of ensuring a secure, tamper-proof,
and permanent record of transactions. The fundamental idea of a
distributed secure ledger was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto
(Nakamoto,
2008). Initially, the technology created bitcoin, which verifies
financial transactions without the requirement for a central authority,
the federal reserve, a central bank, or other financial institution.
Because the method of transaction verification involves a network of
computers, rather than a single computer, it is very fault-tolerant. Any
single computer can be added or removed from the network at any time
without corrupting the ledger of transactions. Because the ledger is
duplicated across all network computers, transactions are secure and
immutable. A key feature of blockchain technology is that it is
trust-less: transactions are processed by the network so there is no
need to trust a single computer, database, or institution. The initial
blockchain created bitcoin, which consists of a secure, immutable,
distributed database of financial transactions. However, the technology
has also been extended to create a system of secure, immutable,
distributed computer programs allowing the creation of smart contracts
and artificial intelligence
(Buterin,
2015).</div><div></div><div><b>Interoperability</b></div><div>


Interoperability is the ability to work together in an oganized manner.
Applied to electronic medical records, interoperability means the
ability of large computer databases containing patient information to
effectively communicate with each other and ultimately communicate the
data to healthcare providers quickly in a meaningful way
(Brodersen
et al., 2016).</div><div></div><div>

Even though the Internet has been has been transmitting data around the
world for almost 50 years now, critically important medical data remains
for the most part hidden away tightly in silos, run by hospitals,
clinics, and insurance companies. This tight lock on patient records
means that even when going a short distance within the same town it is
difficult to access medical records from a different clinic. Although
the clinic is in the same city, the silo housing medical records is just
as isolated as if it was located thousands of miles away. These silos
effectively control medical records, instead of the patient controlling
their own medical records
(Mandl
and Kohane, 2012). Because of the hassle of transferring medical
records, many patients will stay within a single healthcare system for
the sole reason that their medical records are housed within that
system.</div><div></div></div><div></div>
