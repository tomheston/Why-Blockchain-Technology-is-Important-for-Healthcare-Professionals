<b>Abstract.</b> Blockchain technology is a system of creating an
immutable, secure, distributed database of transactions. Blockchains
were initially created to provide a distributed ledger of financial
transactions that did not rely upon a central bank, credit company, or
other financial institution. The technological breakthrough, however,
has been extended to transactions involving legal matters, medical
records, insurance billing, and smart contracts. One primary way that
blockchain technology is important to healthcare professionals in that
it can revolutionize medical database interoperability. This greater
interoperability can help improve access to medical records, imaging
archives, prescription databases. Given that a patient’s medical history
is a primary cornerstone of good medicine, blockchain technology has the
potential to dramatically improve medical care.
