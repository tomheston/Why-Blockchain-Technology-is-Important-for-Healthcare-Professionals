<b>Abstract.</b> Blockchain technology is a system of creating an
immutable, secure, distributed database of transactions. Blockchains
were initially created to provide a distributed ledger of financial
transactions that did not rely upon a central bank, credit company, or
other financial institution. The technological breakthrough, however,
has been extended to transactions involving legal matters, medical
records, insurance billing, and smart contracts. One primary way that
blockchain technology is important to healthcare professionals in that
it can revolutionize medical database interoperability. This greater
interoperability can help improve access to medical records, imaging
archives, prescription databases. Given that a patientâ€™s medical history
is a primary cornerstone of good medicine, blockchain technology has the
potential to dramatically improve medical care.&nbsp;</div></div></blockquote><div><b>Introduction</b></div><div>


Blockchain technology is a system of ensuring a secure, tamper-proof,
and permanent record of transactions. The fundamental idea of a
distributed secure ledger was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto
(Nakamoto,
2008). Initially, the technology created bitcoin, which verifies
financial transactions without the requirement for a central authority,
the federal reserve, a central bank, or other financial institution.
Because the method of transaction verification involves a network of
computers, rather than a single computer, it is very fault-tolerant. Any
single computer can be added or removed from the network at any time
without corrupting the ledger of transactions. Because the ledger is
duplicated across all network computers, transactions are secure and
immutable. A key feature of blockchain technology is that it is
trust-less: transactions are processed by the network so there is no
need to trust a single computer, database, or institution. The initial
blockchain created bitcoin, which consists of a secure, immutable,
distributed database of financial transactions. However, the technology
has also been extended to create a system of secure, immutable,
distributed computer programs allowing the creation of smart contracts
and artificial intelligence

2015).</div>
